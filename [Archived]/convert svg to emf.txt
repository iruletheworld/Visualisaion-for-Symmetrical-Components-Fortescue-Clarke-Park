If you need to convert svg to emf for Windows (which I have to), then you can use inkscape from cmd.

The command is something like

(make sure inkscape is in your PATH or you are in the dir of inkscape installation)
(this has only been tested on Windows 7)

inkscape foo.svg --export-emf=bar.emf

Then, the idea is, put all your svgs in a folder (easier to manage), use Python to get a list of all filenames by type ".svg", then call inkscape to convert all of then to emf.

I might write a function for this. 

Bloody MS Word and all that.
